# Gomoku

School project, finals!

- How it works -
It's a standard game of Gomoku, however the player will be playing against a self-learning (semi) AI that will calculate each move to make sure it does the correct moves to defend, attack and plan against you.

- AI -
The AI are currently running on a algorithm called "Minimax" which takes the branches and neighbors and calculate the only possible way of doing such -- therefore it stores the items that you place and calculates around that to either attack, defend or stay passive.
